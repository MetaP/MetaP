# Use abstraction to minimize effort.

Any solution thus resolves a multitude of problems.

## What I would like it to be

*MetaP* is an attempt to share insights that have accumulated in my mind over a span of more than four decades of software development. I hope they can be useful to you.

I often wonder why we, developers, who automate the business of others, miss so many opportunities to automate our own business.

*MetaP* stands for **m**eta**p**rogramming. [1]

It's about abstraction. The essence separated from the details. The particular distilled out of the general.

It's about modeling. Creating clear and concise models that precisely define what we intend to build. Formal models that can be processed by machines, relieving us from the monotonous and repetitive tasks.


**---**

[1] That the P happens to be the first letter of my first name is, of course, pure coincidence.



## What it currently is

A compilation of repositories, most in an embryonic state, containing ideas and even artifacts that I've employed and will continue to utilize in my day-to-day development efforts.
